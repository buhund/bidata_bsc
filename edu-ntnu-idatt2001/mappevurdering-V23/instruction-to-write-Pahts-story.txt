I want you to write an original story for a game, but it needs to follow a specific format, which I will outline here.

The syntax is as follows

Double colon "::" marks a passage title. E.g. ::Beginnings
The following line contains the story text.
The lines below the story marks the actions the player can take to advance the story. Each [Sometext](othertext) marks a link to another passage, where [] desscribes the action taken, and () contains the name of the passage which follows. There can be two to four such choices/actions.

Here is an example:

´´´paths
Haunted House

::Beginnings
You are in a small, dimly lit room. There is a door in front of you.
[Try to open the door](Another room)
[Knock on the door](Knock Knock)

::Another room
The door opens to another room. You see a desk with a large, dusty book.
[Open the book](The book of spells)
[Go back](Beginnings)

::Knock Knock
You knock the door. And someone answers in a raspy voice, but you cant make out what they say.
[Espace](Flee)
[Hide behind the couch](Hide)

::Hide
You get so scared that you hide behind the couch. You sit there so long that you die from thirst.
[You died](End)

::Flee
You run out the front door as fast as you can. Unfortunately, you trip on the garden gnome, vault forward and find yourself skewered on a pitch fork.
[You died](End)

::End
You died. Such is life.

Do you understand the structure?
