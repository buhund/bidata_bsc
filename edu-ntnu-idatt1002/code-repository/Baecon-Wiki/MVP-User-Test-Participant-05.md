#### Beta/MPP Preview

Showed the new designs for Beta/MPP (Accounting, Dashboard) in SceneBuilder and asked which was preferred (old vs. new).

- The months on top were familiar from applications used at work. More space.
- Better with the columns and row view.
- Sums on bottom! Liked that.
- The new ones were preferred. More ordered and familiar. Looks more like a budget/accounting setup.
