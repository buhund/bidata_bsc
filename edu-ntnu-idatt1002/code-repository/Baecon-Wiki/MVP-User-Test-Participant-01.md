## Test feedback

### 1. Change overview month
The test user found the change of month on the dashboard easily. However, she pressed
the arrow on the right on the dropdown, not the dropdown itself. She also tested the
keyboard shortcut Alt + down arrow for displaying the different months, which worked.

### 2. Find the budget page.
The test user found the budget page quickly by pressing on the “Budget” button on the
left sidebar.

### 3. Add a new income to the budget
She easily entered a new expected income to the budget, by pressing the “add income”
button, and filling in the blanks in the popup window. While deciding the category for the
expected income, she tried to write a “r” in the comboBox for “rent”, after pressing the
arrow which displayed the categories.

### 4. Set a recurring income
Went smoothly, checked of the checkBox and chose a weekly repetition in the following
comboBox.

### 5. Add a new expense to the budget
Went well with the experience from adding a new income to the budget. Suggested
possibly changing the “add” buttons (see 14 a).

### 6. Find the accounting page.
No problem. Pressing the “Accounting” button on the left sidebar.

### 7. Add a new income to the accounting
Went smoothly. Commented that the buttons for adding a new income or expense in the
accounting were placed somewhere else in the budget side. Also a bit much info with
displaying the time in the accounts. Making a header with “Acounting” + month + year
was suggested. Else having a header over the parameters of an accounting entry.

### 8. Add new expense to the accounting
Same as 7.

### 9. Find the expense from 12.03.2023
The test user found the expense from 12.03.2023 easily by clicking on the button
“march”, but seems a sorting by date can solve the search. Suggested a search bar similar
to the one in “Receipts” as a feature if time, where it could be possible to search for a
specific accounting entry by its title, date or amount.
### 10. Find your scanned receipts
Due to MVP the page is not finished, but the test user pressed on the “receipt” button in
the accounting page, before going to the receipt side via the left sidebare, because she
already was located at the accounting page. Suggested a paper clip or a logo representing
the receipt, and making it turn to a color or shade when it holds a receipt.

### 11. Determine whether you made a profit or made a loss from the previous month
Found it hard to find, a little small.

### 12. Add a new category
She created a new category without a problem. Nice page, all of the other ones can take
inspiration from this one for maintaining continuity throughout the application. Liked that
one could tap on one line that turns blue, and then press delete or edit. Same can be done
in the budgeting and accounting pages.

### 13. Edit an existing category
Commented that the name on the existing category should be included in the popup box
appearing when trying to edit a category name.

### 14. General Feedback
1. What is your overall impression of the MVP?
A lot of good ideas, and sees that the team had planned for a lot of convenient
features. But it is evident that the pages is made by different peoples, maybe due
to the scenes where created by the template of the Wireframes and not a common
theme.
2. Something lacking in comparison with the Wireframes?
Nothing other than the buttons not working. But the test user had an understanding
that this was a MVP.
3. What is your favorite feature in the MVP?
Settings page (see 12).
4. Any suggestion for improvements (features, colors, layout etc.)?
Further suggestions, light green theme, sum for the overview, budget and possible
the accounting.
