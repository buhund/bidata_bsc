# Test Feedback

### Change overview month:
- Easy, but selector seems to be a bit out of place.
- Graphs and table could possibly switch places

### Find the budget
- Easy
- Looks good

### Add income to budget
- Easy.
- But "+"-button doesn't particularly stand out as an action (resembles a bullet-point)

### Set a recurring income
- Easy, looks okay.

### Set current budget as default
- Works, but too hidden

### Find your various expenses and income
- Easy enough

### Add new expense
- Works
- Should receipt-option be availble when repeated?

### Find a specific expense during one month
- Easy to find monthly overview
- May need filtering-options or a search-bar

###  Find your scanned recipes
- Works

### General Feedback
- In general okay design, but feels a bit cluttered at some times

### Something lacking?
- Nothing that stands out.

### Any suggestion for improvements?
- Make some of the small hidden pieces more visible instead of hidden away, ex. "Use as default monthly budget"
