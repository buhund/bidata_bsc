# Test Feedback

### Change overview month:
* Went well, found the drop down menu and changed the month of the overview
* Missed summation of budget and accounts

### Find the budget
* Clicked on the budgetbutton to the left
* Liked that the button turned blue to show which page was being viewed 

### Add income to budget
* Much happening on this page
* Pressed the button, could consider naming it "add"

### Set a recurring income
* Logical and easy

### Set current budget as default
* Took some time to find, small
* Necessary? When there is a option to set the entry repeatedly
* Wondered how the month and year were changed in the budget page, when the default button only previewed the month

### Find your various expenses and income
* Went well

### Add new expense
* Easy

### Find a specific expense during one month
* No problem

###  Find your scanned recipes
- Easy

### General Feedback
- Nice setup, easy to manuver between the pages with the lefthand sidebar

### Something lacking?
* Nothing beyond what has already been mentioned

### Any suggestion for improvements?
* Make the application cohesive
