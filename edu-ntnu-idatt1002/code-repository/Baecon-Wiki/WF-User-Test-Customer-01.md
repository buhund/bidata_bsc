## Test Feedback

### 1. Change overview month.
The customer presses the “Overview –“month”” and finds the month selector. Still, he expresses
wishes to install a toggle bar besides the “Overview” title to make the interface even more clear.

### 2. Find the budget.
The customer looks directly to the side bar and presses the “Budget” button.

### 3. Add income to budget
User navigates to the “+” button beside the “Income” title and presses it.

#### 3.1. Set a recurring income
The customer find this part of the UX lacking. He wants this feature to be configured with a
repeat every day, week, month or year options.

### 4. Set current budget as default
The customer find this feature useful. But after further consideration with the team, the feature is
considered redundant because of the “Set recurring income/expense” function.

### 5. Find your various expenses and income
The user presses the “Accounting” button on the left side bar of the window.
#### 5.1. Find a specific expense during one month
The user locates the “Search” feature at the top of the page and clicks it.

### 6. Find your scanned recipes
The costumer presses the “Receipt” button on the side bar.

### 7. General Feedback
- The team noticed the customer trying to press directly on the “amount” post on the
“Budget” page. The team concluded that this happened because of the square boxes the
“amounts” was displayed in. Therefore, we have removed the squares in MVP.
- The customer also expressed a desire to change the bar chart on the Dashboard. Here, he
would like a overview of total income and total expenses usage instead of usage based on
categories.
- The customer indicated a preference for retaining the current layout of the wireframes, rather than adopting a new design with a more consistent layout.
