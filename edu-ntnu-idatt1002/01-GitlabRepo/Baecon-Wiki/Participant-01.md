### 14. General feedback
- It's easy to understand how to use the program
- The table view on the dashboard can be a bit overwhelming and hard to navigate because it shows a lot of data. A better solution would be to only display the categories that have registered entries for the selected month. 
- The test participant has partial red-green color blindness but was still able to distinguish between the bars, lines, and sectors on the charts. She found it easier to read the charts with colorblind mode enabled.
