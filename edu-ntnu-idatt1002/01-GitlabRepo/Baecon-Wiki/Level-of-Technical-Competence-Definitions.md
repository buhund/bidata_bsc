Level of Technical Competence Definitions, used for user test participant categorization.

___

## Preamble

These leves are mostly defined by personal knowledge of people who fit them. They are not scientific, but they do draw on principles from research done by actors such as OECD on computer litteracy, and work by the Nielsen Norman Group on UX and design. Generally, most are worse at using computers than one would think(1). The below defined levels are loosely based on the groups defined in the findings by OECD, referred to in the NN Group article.

___

### You ≠ User

An important principle in the field of interaction design.

>Summary: The foundation of user experience is the difference between the people on the design team and the people using the product. You can't ask users to design, but you also can't ask the designers whether their own design will be easy for the target audience to use.

# Level of Technical Competence Definitions

_**NOTE: These levels on those defined by NNGroup, but as one can see, the NNGroup ladder have 3 levels, whereas our have 4.**_


## Level 1 - Very Low
At Level 1, you are more or less unable to use a computer at all. You can use a "dumb" phone, or even possibly a smart phone, for very basic tasks, but you are basically technologically illiterate.

Stereotypes:
- Grandma/grandpa who have never touched a computer.
- People who live completely without interacting with anything other than the most basic of operations on their TV remote or phone.

## Level 2 - Low
Level 2 is the very basic bar for interacting with a computer in a somewhat productive manner. It works, but that's it.

- Likely uses almost exclusively mobile devices (phone, tablet).
- Technology is mostly used for entertainment purposes.
- Uses a computer almost exclusively for low-level web content ( e.g. banking, social media).
- Uses very few, if any, computer applications outside of the ones pre-installed and shipped with the computer. 
- Mostly uses closed eco-systems like those provided by Apple, Google and Microsoft, if at all.
- Uses the computer almost 100% as it was set up from the vendor.
- Little to no knowledge of what exists beyone what came pre-installed on their phone or laptop.
- Liable to respond to phising e-mails.
- Have no significant interest in technology, outside what society "demands".
- Consumers of technology, but with little to no understanding of it.
- Can follow simple instructions for doing somewhat advanced tasks.
- Are often not bothered by having to close malware windows launched at every computer start-up; would just close them and continue on with their stuff.

Stereotypes:
- Teen (13-19) or [young-adult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult) (18-39) who "lives" on their phone.
- Grandpa/grandma, who mostly looks at pictures of grandkids on social media or reading the news.
- Students in non-technical fields of study.


## Level 3 - Medium
Level 3 are moderate users of technology, who can use a computer productively and capable og some advanced use. You're likely to unconsciously accept and adapt to a prescribed cookie-cutter workflow, even if it's suboptimal for you.

- Have installed and configured applications that didn't come pre-installed.
- Plays games via third-party software, like Steam, Battle.net and Epic Games.
- Have a basic knowledge of the settings available on the computer (i.e. can find the settings pages).
- May have changed a few settings, but nothing "advanced".
- Completely comfortable (even if reluctant) with using a desktop/laptop computer and navigating between several types of applications and around the system.
- May even have overclock hardware via applications like MSI Afterburner.
- Unlikely to respons to phising and other attempts at scamming.
- Able to solve somewhat advanced problems on their own. Able to find and integrate information.

Stereotypes:
- The happy and smiling middle-aged user, who have no significant skills or knowledge in technology, but "enjoy using it".
- Students in technical fields of study.
- Office workers.
- Gamers (users who use computers primarily as a means to play video games).


## Level 4 - High or Very High
Level 4 users are very adept at using computers and technology to suit their own needs, instead of adapting to the system's and/or application's definition of what the "correct" workflow is, but also would not have any problems using the "correct" workflow if required. Cookie-cutter doesn't cut it anymore. High level of knowledge of laws, regulations and philosohpical topics realting to technology and its uses.

- Are comfortable with altering advances configs, like BIOS or UEFI settings.
- Can assemble a computer themselves.
- Have very good knowledge of the settings available in their daily-driver operating system.
- Have installed an operating system on a computer via USB or disc images.
- Have used "alternative" operating systems like Linux, or even more niché ones, over an extended period of time. OS horizion is not limited to "mainstream" (i.e. Windows and Mac OS). Would have no issues moving between platforms.
- Have at least some basic knowledge of computer programming.
- Able to comfortably use a terminal to perform tasks on their own computer, as well as remotes.
- Have tinkered with, and can set up, niché devices like Raspberry Pi as e.g. network-wide adblocker or media server.
- Have built software from source, outside an IDE.
- Knows what a "kernel" refers to, in computer terms, and have a decent, if general, knowledge about how a computer actually works, both in terms of software and hardware layers.
- Tinkers with computers and/or other electronics on their spare time.
- Knowledge of technological and design concepts and functionality:
   - A wide and at least general knowledge of concepts like how VMs, online tracking, display servers, window managers and network routers work.
   - Technical insight into both old and new technology.
   - Aware of research about both the positive and the negative ways in which technology affects humans, both as indiviuals and as a society.
   - Aware of how interaction design and software design can be, and are, used for both good and nefarious purposes.
- Have set up servers, e.g. NAS or a home media server, at some point.
- Can solve advanced problems by searching for and integrating information.
- You entered vim and didn't panic.

Stereotypes:
- Nerds.
- Programmers.
- Computer and technology enthusiasts.
- Electronics Rights and Regulation advocates.


The upper percentiles of Level 4 are experts at using their computer and adapting it to suit their own needs and demands. High level of understanding of inner workings of hardware and software, both technical and theoretical. High level of knowledge of laws, regulations and philosohpical topics realting to technology and its uses.

- Completely comfortable with using non-"consumer" operating systems.
- Able to use all three major operating systems at a "power user" level. No real issues switching between them at will.
- Have very good knowledge of, and long experience with, all the three major operating systems (Mac OS, Windows and Linux).
- Would be completely comfortable with having to use the terminal instead of the GUI for navigating around the operating system and performing file handling, editing configs, as well as more advanced tasks.
- Have compiled custom drivers.
- Have very good knowledge of the interal workings of a computer, both software and hardware.
- Able to use SSH and/or Telnet to remote into "dead" network equipment and repair it.
- High-level electronics tinkerer.
- Can solve very complex problems, given the time or inclination to do so.

Stereotypes:
- Nerd enthusiasts.
- Full-stack developers.
- Old-school computer programmers.



# Notes

### A note on "Transitional" Levels of Competence

- Some users are categorized as "someLevel to otherLevel". 
- This is because not all fall squarely in one category or the other.
- Particiants were asked to rank themselves, where some gave a response like "well, probably low to medium, because such-and-such". 
- This a very common response, which most people would likely find familiar.
- Even if our Levels have been fairly broadly, yet narrowly, specified, it is always hard to put someone in exactly one category.
- Thus, to allow for the fact that people aren't made to fit "square holes", test participants were assigned the categorization they saw fit for themselves, as long as they were able to give a plausible reason as to why they felt that particular way.


### A note on "Philosophical" Computer Knowledge

Level 4 High (maybe even Very High?).

Philosophical, or "soft", knowledge refers to knowledge about computer "idiologies", theoretical debates, moral and ethical questions, as well as laws and regulations, with regards to computers, software, IT and technology in general.

**Examples of topics one should be aware of, and be reasonably informed about:** 
- Privacy in the "Connected" age. Regulations, as well as moral and ethical sides of the discussion.
- Design patterns, and how they affect how humans interact with computers and technology.
   - Good design patterns: Transparancy, design meant to make using technology easy and accessible, HIG (Human Interface Guidelines), Best Practices for GUI design, etc.
   - [Deceptive Design](https://www.deceptive.design/): Knowledge of how design can be used for manipulative, even nefarious, purposes. E.g. make people give away personal information unneccessary (hotel Wifi landing pages, many web pages and mobile apps), require online accounts where there is no actual good reason for it (Windows 11/10, many modern apps), give an impression of scarcity and urgency (Amazon and other webshops). 
- Social media, and how their algorithms are design to bring out the worst in people, by playing on their emotions and virality, instead of good facts.
- An awareness of "Surveillance Capitalism" and the implications of it.
- Government overreach, in terms of privacy.
- The problem that legislation has not caught up to technology, and is often implemented in a reactionary form.

In terms of computer's and computer science, there is no offical brach called "computer philosphy", even if there are people who are just that. People like [Jaron Lanier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier) and [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) are vocal advocates of computers and software working *for* humans, instead of the notion that humans should adapt to suit the limitations (real and by-design) of computers and software, and do philosophize about human-machine interactions and how they shape both individuals and society. The title of one of Lanier's books, "You are not a gadget", sums up this view nicely. Additionally, scientists like [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom) are leading the debate on AI, and their potential dangers. Many more have expressed their misgivings about how Social Media is specifically designed to play on, and amplify, the worst in people.

In addition to the technical expertise and know-how, individuals at Level 4 (High to Very High) should have at least a decent amount of knowledge about these "soft" topics.



### Computer Skills, by NN Group

_**NOTE: These levels on those defined by NNGroup, but as one can see, the NNGroup ladder have 3 levels, whereas our have 4.**_


Source: [The Distribution of Users’ Computer Skills: Worse Than You Think](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/)


#### The 4 Levels of Technology Proficiency

The researchers defined 4 levels of proficiency, based on the types of tasks users can complete successfully. For each level, here’s the percentage of the population (averaged across the OECD countries) who performed at that level, as well as the report’s definition of the ability of people within that level.
“Below Level 1” = 14% of Adult Population

Being too polite to use a term like “level zero,” the OECD researchers refer to the lowest skill level as “below level 1.”

This is what people below level 1 can do: “Tasks are based on well-defined problems involving the use of only one function within a generic interface to meet one explicit criterion without any categorical or inferential reasoning, or transforming of information. Few steps are required and no sub-goal has to be generated.”

An example of task at this level is “Delete this email message” in an email app.

#### Level 1 = 29% of Adult Population

This is what level-1 people can do: 
- “Tasks typically require the use of widely available and familiar technology applications, such as email software or a web browser.
- Little or no navigation required to access the information or commands required to solve the problem. 
- The problem may be solved regardless of the respondent’s awareness and use of specific tools and functions (e.g. a sort function). 
- The tasks involve few steps and a minimal number of operators. At the cognitive level, the respondent can readily infer the goal from the task statement; problem resolution requires the respondent to apply explicit criteria; and there are few monitoring demands (e.g. the respondent does not have to check whether he or she has used the appropriate procedure or made progress towards the solution). 
- Identifying content and operators can be done through simple match. 
- Only simple forms of reasoning, such as assigning items to categories, are required; there is no need to contrast or integrate information.”

The reply-to-all task described above requires level-1 skills. Another example of level-1 task is “Find all emails from John Smith.”


#### Level 2 = 26% of Adult Population

This is what level-2 people can do: 
- “At this level, tasks typically require the use of both generic and more specific technology applications. For instance, the respondent may have to make use of a novel online form. 
- Some navigation across pages and applications is required to solve the problem. 
- The use of tools (e.g. a sort function) can facilitate the resolution of the problem. 
- The task may involve multiple steps and operators. 
- The goal of the problem may have to be defined by the respondent, though the criteria to be met are explicit. 
- There are higher monitoring demands. 
- Some unexpected outcomes or impasses may appear. 
- The task may require evaluating the relevance of a set of items to discard distractors. 
- Some integration and inferential reasoning may be needed.”

An example of level-2 task is “You want to find a sustainability-related document that was sent to you by John Smith in October last year.”


#### Level 3 = 5% of Adult Population

- This is what this most-skilled group of people can do: “At this level, tasks typically require the use of both generic and more specific technology applications. 
- Some navigation across pages and applications is required to solve the problem. 
- The use of tools (e.g. a sort function) is required to make progress towards the solution. 
- The task may involve multiple steps and operators. 
- The goal of the problem may have to be defined by the respondent, and the criteria to be met may or may not be explicit. 
- There are typically high monitoring demands. 
- Unexpected outcomes and impasses are likely to occur. 
- The task may require evaluating the relevance and reliability of information in order to discard distractors. 
- Integration and inferential reasoning may be needed to a large extent.”

The meeting room task described above requires level-3 skills. Another example of level-3 task is “You want to know what percentage of the emails sent by John Smith last month were about sustainability.”

#### Can’t Use Computers = 26% of Adult Population

The numbers for the 4 skill levels don’t sum to 100% because a large proportion of the respondents never attempted the tasks, being unable to use computers. In total, across the OECD countries, 26% of adults were unable to use a computer.

That one quarter of the population can’t use a computer at all is the most serious element of the digital divide. To a great extent, this problem is caused by computers still being much too complicated for many people.


#### You: 5-8%

- The main point I want to make is that you, dear reader, are almost certainly in the top category of computer skills, level 3. 
- In the United States, only 5% of the population has these high computer skills. 
- In Australia and the UK 6% are at this level; 
- in Canada and across Northern Europe the number increases to 7%; 
- Singapore and Japan are even better with a level-3 percentage of 8%.
