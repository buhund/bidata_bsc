## Test Feedback

### 1. Change overview month
The client finds the toggle bar beside the title with ease. Although, wishes the default(current)
month might be a little clearer to navigate to.

### 2. Find the budget page.
This is done without any problems.

### 3. Add a new income to the budget
This is also done without any difficulty. The user also finds the UX to be satisfying.

### 4. Set a recurring income
The user automatically does this when performing task number 3. Also, with ease.

### 5. Add a new expense to the budget
This task was completed without any hesitation.

### 6. Find the accounting page.
The client immediately found the “Accounting” button on the left side and pressed it.

### 7. Add a new income to the accounting
This task was done without any need for help or further instructions.

### 8. Add new expense to the accounting
As expected, the client performed this task with speed and without any confusion. However, he
did express wishes to add “something” to the top bar where the two “Add”-buttons where. When
asked, he agreed that a title containing “Account – CurrentMonthInView” would be a good
edition.

### 9. Find the expense from 12.03.2023
The program initially failed to run on the client’s computer. This was caused by a code
malfunction in the preset list of expenses and incomes in “Accounting”. Therefore, the client has
problems completing this task, seeing how the only entries on his list was the ones from the
previous tasks. However, the client did navigate to the correct month to start looking for the
correct entry.

### 10. Find your scanned receipts
The client when straight to the left side bar in the program window and pressed the “Receipt”
button. However, he did express wishes to change the name to “Archive” or something of that
nature because he would like to store both incomes pay slips and receipts of expenses in the
program.

### 11. Determine whether you made a profit or made a loss from the previous month
The client clicked the “Dashboard” button on the left side bar and started looking for result, again, only
with the inputs he had made earlier in the test. It now became noticeable that the overview did not give
a good enough picture of the results. The income set on the budget page and the income set on the
accounting page did not correspond. This made the overview page show that the client had reached a
negative result in his “Salary” category. Something that was perceived as unnatural and confusing. After
some discussion the conclusion was reached that to make the “Overview” better and easier to
understand, the categories should be split up and set under “Income” and “Expenses” like in the
“Budget” page. Furthermore, the calculations of “Overview” -income would need to be refactored to
better suit the needs of that particular post. Also, it seemed that the “month” selector did not change
monthly overview correctly.

### 12. Add a new category
The used paused for half a second before pointing to the “Settings” button on the left sidebar and
clicking it. The feature was received with enthusiasm. However, he did express wishes for there
to be added a “+” button beside the category toggle bar on the Budget entry pages (both income
and expenses).

### 13. Edit an existing category
The client found this feature somewhat confusing. However, the confusion was exacerbated by
some lacking methods in the program to make the feature work. When explained by the
developer how the feature would work when the feature was completed, the client seemed
satisfied with that part of the program as well.

### 14. General Feedback

#### 14.1. What is your overall impression of the MVP?
The client was overall pleased with the resulting program so far. He was impressed by the teams’
efforts and liked the overall “feel” of the program. He did however emphasize that the vbox on
the “Accounting” page did look a little bare and would like a headline put in. The team had
earlier discussed putting in the “month” side bar that is installed on the “Accounting” page on to
both the “Overview” and/or “Budget” page as well. However, the client did not wish for and
rather expressed he would like the same kind of ~~toggle~~ combobox(?) bar from “Overview” to be installed on
the ”Budget” page.

#### 14.2. Something lacking in comparison with the Wireframes?
The used test revealed that the client would like the scaling on the “Budget” page to be bigger.
More like in the Wireframes version. He also missed the “donut” chart that was present in the
wireframes but was pleased to hear that it was already but into the scene but was not visible
because the input data is not yet connected to the installed chart.

#### 14.3. What is your favorite feature in the MVP?
The client was particularly happy with the layout on the “Overview” page and was excited to see
how it would look when the charts are connected to the data. Furthermore, he liked the line
separators that were present in the “Overview” page and wished something similar to be installed
into the “Accounting” page.

#### 14.4. Any suggestion for improvements (features, colors, layout etc.)?
The aforementioned lines between inputs on the “Accounting” page was again mentioned when
asked this question. He also wanted to have the “Receipt” title on the “addAccountingEntries” to
be changed seeing how he would like to add pay slips and similar items also. Finally, the client
expressed he would like to have an extra ~~toggle~~ combobox bar on the “Receipt” page, next to the Month and
year ~~toggle~~ combobox bars. Here he would like to choose a category to filter out unnecessary entries.
