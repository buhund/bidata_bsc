# Test Feedback

### 1. Change overview month:
- Which month am I in now? Only says month in the dropdown, nowhere else suggests what month at start.
Should only show month and year.
- Align dropdown to left

### 2. Find the budget page
- Doesn't look very trustworthy, to many dollar signs, haha.

### 3. Add a new income to the budget
- Why does repeat show when I've not ticked repeat. What does it do when I check it?
- Also checked repeat without selecting anything, so I'm not sure how many it repeats
- Tried clicking. The middle of the combobox.
- Doesn't show the selected repeat on the combobox. Only "Repeat"
- Very critical error! :D
- Food and entertainment income :thumbs_up
- Cannot input with comma decimal, even though it shows comma in the budget view.
 

### 4. Set a recurring income
- Added a recurring income, I think. No feedback given en.

### 5. Add a new expense to the budget
- Same
- Can use the app with an open expense dialog
- Can have two open.
- Should set limit to number of numbers

### 6. Find the accounting page
- Found it
- Which month am I currently viewing?
- Dates indicates march but no "big" indicator.
- Why aren't months as dropdowns?
- No buttons seems to work

### 7. Add a new income to the accounting
- Hjelpetekst vanished when I clicked inside the amount box
- Screen reader may not always catch ghost text
- Empty repeat box. Doesn't repeat.
- Not allow line breaks if you cannot use line breaks.
- Linebreak once, breaks the Description input 
- letters in input breaks the app

### 8. Add new expense to the accounting
- Same same 

### 9. Find the expense from 12.03.2023
- Found it
- What's the deal with timestamps. Dummy data has time, but real data doesn't (i.e. 00:00:00).

### 10. Find your scanned receipts
- Yes. Clicked receipts.
- Previous interface indicated that there should be receipts, since there's a button there. Added entries also show a receipt button. Why, when there's no receipts?
- How does search work? Will it override a set time range? Or will it search within the set month
- Filter search?
- The bar hierarchy suggests that the bar on top will search global, while if it was inside the scroll pane it would search within the defined time parameters.
- Looks like global search (which was the intended function).
- Can I filter search results by the month/year?
- Open File Location opens where the files are
- Copy to downloads? Export receipt instead? Only export. Open File Loc is tech level 7
- 

### 11. Determine whether you made a profit or a loss from the previous month
- Accounting. February. No entries in there. No idea. No sums in accounting.
- Went to budget. Didn't notice the sum hidden in the corner
- Went to dashboard. Can't find any summary. Would have to use a calculator.

### 12. Add a new category
- Settings. Categories. New. Pretty easy.

### 13. Edit an existing category
- Works but doesn't work.

### 14. General feedback
- Dashboard: 
-- not self explanatory graphs. 
-- Overview looks good, but too much whitespace makes it hard to read. Should also have a summary of the results. Should default to current month.
- Budget:
-- E and D buttons are what? Does $$$$ mean total sum?
- Accounting:
-- Maybe use tabs (better overview) go dropdown for a better UI layout.
-- Main menu on side, module menu/buttons on top.
- Probably not WCAG compliant ;)
