# BigBÃ¦reumEconomy (BBE) Feedback

## Change overview month:
- Easy, but selector seems to be a bit out of place...
- Graphs and table could possibly switch places

## Find the budget
- Easy
- Looks good

## Add income to budget
- Easy
- But "+"-button doesn't particularly stand out as an action (resembles a bullet-point)

## Set a recurring income
- Easy, looks okay.

## Set current budget as default
- Works, but too hidden

## Find your various expenses and income
- Easy enough

## Add new expense
- Works
- Should receipt-option be availble when repeated?

## Find a specific expense during one month
- Easy to find monthly overview
- May need filtering-options or a search-bar

##  Find your scanned recipes
- Works

## General Feedback
- In general okay design, but feels a bit cluttered at some times

## Something lacking?
- Nothing that pops out.

## Any suggestion for improvements?
- Make some of the small hidden pieces more visible instead of hidden away, ex. "Use as default monthly budget"
